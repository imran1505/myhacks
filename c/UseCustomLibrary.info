To learn how to create a library see file CreateCustomLibrary.info

** STEPS **

1. Include your custom library in your c file. 

    #include "lib/myExampleLib.h"   /** if this lib file is in lib directory"


2. Compile the library 

    If your library files ( both .h and .c) files are located in "lib" directory, then type the following command.
         gcc -o mylib.o -c lib/utils.c
    This command will create an output lib file named "mylib.o"


3. Complile your C program with the compiled library 

    gcc mySampleProgram.c mylib.o

Now you can run your program.
Also step 2 is required only there is a change in your custom library files.
